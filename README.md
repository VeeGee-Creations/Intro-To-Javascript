# Pokedex

### Description
A web app which loads a complete listing of currently released pokemon from [api](https://pokeapi.co/).

Pokemon are expandable, offering basic stats (i.e. height, weight, type, abilities) along with a photo of the Pokemon.

The search bar will find pokemon by name. It will match the search string with any part of the name. Can't remember how to spell the pokemon you want? Try searching for just a few characters from it's name!
